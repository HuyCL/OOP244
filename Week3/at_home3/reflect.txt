1) The character string for family/given name is supposed to hold 40 characters long, so when declaring an array, the terminator character, '\0' / NULL, is taken into account. For example, create an array that can hold 40 characters, we declare char array[41] instead of char array[40] because of the extra NULL character.

2) C++ is capable of overloading function. Overloaded functions can have the same name but with the condition that the parameters must be different.

3) Through this workshop, I familiarized myself with overloaded functions. I learned how to convert an integer into an array. I created a different function outside of the ones mentioned in the workshop to accomplish a task.
