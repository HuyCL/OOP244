1) No, Hero class does not need to know about the existence of SuperHero because it is the base class.

2) Yes, SuperHero class need to know about the existence of Hero because SuperHero class is derived from Hero class.

3) The print out was "Ancient Battle!" because SuperHero cannot use super power, for the overloaded operator* in Hero.cpp was called.

4) True because constructor will be called and accept valid data.

5) True because similarly to question 4, the constructor will still be called even though it was written differently.
