1) Operator+ should not return a reference to a Fraction object because this operator is adding current object to another object but we are NOT defining current object with new values. If we want to record new values, a new object is required.

2) ( a + b )  - Temporary object
   ( b + d )  - Temporary object
   ( b += d ) - Temporary object
   ( a == c ) - Not temporary object
   ( a != c ) - Not temporary object

3) One of the simplifications that I used was utilizing operator(s) inside another operator to accomplish task. This helped me avoid rewriting similar code again in another operator. I also used isEmpty() function when necessary. Though isEmpty() function is a small simple function, it helped minimizing a lot of my code.

4) In this workshop, I learned how to use operators to accomplish multiple tasks with objects.I also learned to use an overloaded operator inside another operator to be more efficient with my code.
